    "paragraph1": "My full-stack web development journey began in early 2023 when I joined Kodehode, a comprehensive full-stack course.",
    "paragraph2": "Iâ€™m well-versed in React, Node, and Express, which I use to create cool and interactive web apps. Additionally,  I've also independently explored the basics of Cypress, broadening my skills beyond front-end technologies. Before diving into web development, I gained valuable experience as a QA tester at United Coder LLC from 2020 to 2022.",
    "paragraph3": "Even as a junior developer, I believe that the little things matter in web development. Iâ€™m dedicated to creating user-friendly interfaces and optimizing the overall user experience. Seeing people enjoy and benefit from the apps I build motivates me to keep pushing the boundaries of design and functionality.",
